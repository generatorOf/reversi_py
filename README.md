# reversi_py
(c) Evgeny Mironov


reversi game in python, I have started last week for programming learning aims

first version works in terminal
the next steps will be gui version
and I will find some rules for choosing the next step automatically (alias AI)

the communication is so far in half german half engish...

in terminal it looks uggly, but it already works and you can try it, if you have python 3 installed
